                            <p>There are three programmes run under the auspice of ACENTDFB which are domiciled in Department of Biochemistry i.e. PGD Forensic Biotechnology, M.Sc Biotechnology and Ph.D Biotechnology </p>
                            <p>Note that Research emphases for both M.Sc and Ph.D Biotechnology are on neglected tropical diseases, specifically Trypanosomiasis, Lymphatic Filiariasis, Onchocerciasis, Rabies, Dengue, and Trachoma. </p>

                            <h4>Q2. What is the duration of your programmes?</h4>
                            <p>The Minimum duration for M.Sc Biotechnology is 2 years (4 semesters), where the first two semesters involve rigorous taught courses which are examined and the remaining two semesters are dedicated to research work. In a situation where a student is unable to complete his programme within the minimum duration, the university gives a maximum grace of another 18 months where a student must complete his programme. </p>

                            <p>For Ph.D Biotechnology Student, a minimum duration of 3 years i.e 6 semesters; where depending on student’s transcripts, some taught courses can be prescribed in the first two semesters which are examined before the commencement of the research work which is expected to last for 2 years. Similarly, extension can be sought based on the progress of the research work and the university can grant a maximum duration of additional 2 years. <p>

                            <p>In case of PGD Forensic Biotechnology, it is a professional diploma programme that includes an examinable course work and research project with maximum duration of 18 months. </p>

                            <p>To apply into any of our programmes, you need to visit School of Postgraduate Studies, Ahmadu Bello University Zaria website via <a href="https://spgs.abu.edu.ng/forms/" target="_blank">https://spgs.abu.edu.ng/forms/</a>. From the webpage by the right, there is “create account” where you are expected to input your valid email address and a password of your choice. A confirmation will be sent to mail and then you can login to fill the application form accordingly by providing all the needed information related to your personal and academic background. </p>

                            <h4>Q6. Is there any application fee, if so, how much? </h4>
                            <p>Yes, there is application processing fee of payable to School of Postgraduate Studies, Ahmadu Bello University Zaria via Remita at any commercial bank in Nigeria. The prospective applicants outside the country tends to have challenges regarding the payment of processing fee (though Remita is now available in some countries e.g. Ghana), where the local currency payment of #10,000 (equivalent to 30 USD) can be made. The university is currently working on this, to ensure that regional/international applicants can pay their processing fee without any difficulty. Based on this, applicants with such challenges can liaise with ACENTDFB so that any issues regarding the processing fee can be handled effectively. </p>

                            <h4>Q7. How do I pay application fee since I am not a Nigerian?</h4>
                            <p>Once you complete your application form, you will be prompted to generate the transaction ID for payment of processing fee. After generating the transaction ID then there are two ways that application processing fee can be paid; the first involves the use of Remita in any commercial banks that have that window/platform as it is available in some ECOWAS countries and the second one may require anyone within the country to make payment on your behalf using local currency (#10,000 which is equivalent to 30 USD) in Nigerian commercial bank via Remita. Note that for payment to be made on your behalf; your username and password need to be made known to that person. </p>
